In 2019, I worked as a product designer at [TurnTo Networks](https://www.pixlee.com/) (now Emplifi), a company that builds products that enable e-commerce retailers to collect quality customer-generated content for their shoppers. Shoppers use that content to make more informed purchasing decisions. In my time there I was primarily allocated to the establishment of our design system, called Speedflex.

The TurnTo core product allowed enterprise clients to match the colors and styling of our widget to the look and feel of their e-commerce site. When I joined TurnTo, a designer they had contracted had built many many comps of screens depicting our tools, but they were not using Sketch components. They also had to be manually adjusted to reflect the theming capabilities of our system.\
\
My work on establishing our design system was both in configuring Sketch components, and pairing with engineering to build them, but also in laying the groundwork to use variables that allowed us to rapidly update the look and feel of the design system in a particular implementation.
